# Crush-Valentine-invitation
This is a playful and interactive Valentineâ€™s Day invitation where I ask my crush whether she would like to go out with me. The twist? She can see both "Yes" and "No" options, but no matter what she chooses, the answer will always be "Yes"! ðŸ˜†

âœ¨ Features:

A simple yet creative way to invite someone on a date.
A tricky "Yes/No" prompt where "No" magically turns into "Yes"!
Cute and romantic UI to make it more fun.
ðŸ‘€ How it Works:

The user (my crush) sees a question: "Will you be my Valentine?"
There are two buttons: Yes and No.
If she clicks "Yes"â€”great! ðŸŽ‰ If she clicks "No"â€”oops, it still turns into "Yes"! ðŸ˜œ
ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the button trickery).
ðŸ¥° Why This Project?
I wanted to create a lighthearted and sweet way to pop the big question. Hopefully, she'll find it fun and say "Yes" with a smile! ðŸ’•
